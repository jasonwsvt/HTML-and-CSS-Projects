		<h1><b><u>These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.</u></b></h1>
		<div>
			<p>By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. This is <i>your</i> world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. <i>La-da-da-da-dah.</i> Just be happy. You can do anything your heart can imagine. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</p>
			<p><i>You</i> create the dream - then you bring it into your world. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Zip. That easy.</p>
